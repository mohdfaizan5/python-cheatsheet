# Create function



#游녤In this we are defining a simple function:
def hello():    #def means define a new function
    print("hello")
#just defining a function is not enough we also need to call them:
hello() #() parenthisis say that this is a function


#游녤In this we are defining a function with a parameter
def hello(parameter):
    print(f"Hello {parameter}")

#calling a funtion with a parameter 
hello("faizan") #computer automatically assigns "faizan" as parameter and further computes faizan in the func

#游녤In this we are defining a function with 2 or more parameters
def hello(parameter1, parameter2):
    print(f"Name:{parameter1}")
    print(f"Age: {parameter2}")

#calling a function with 2 parameter 
    #here we give 2 parameter while calling a function seperated with commma ","
hello("faizan","18") #computer automatically assigns faizan as name
#                                                     18 as age
