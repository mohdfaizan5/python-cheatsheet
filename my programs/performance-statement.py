OTHER REFERENCE:

The best way to figure out what your personal formula for success is in a given area, is to answer the following question:

Imagine that you are about to compete in the biggest game of your life, and the best coach you have ever had is standing right next to you. Sixty seconds before the competition begins, your coach looks you in the eye and tells you that if you stay focused on this one thing or these two things, you will be successful today. What one or two things would the coach name?

Now picture yourself in a high stakes situation for the skill you’re focusing on. Maybe asking out someone you like if you want to improve your social skills, or running a race if you want to be a better runner, or getting along with your family if that’s a goal for you.

But right before the big moment, your best friend or coach or therapist pulls you aside, looks you in the eye and says “Remember, stay focused on ____, if you do that, success will follow.” Fill in the blank to create a performance statement.

It’s important to personalize your performance statements, but here are some examples of great ones you can model yours after.

For when you don’t feel like exercising:
“Just start playing my power song, and put my gym clothes on.”

For when you are tempted by unhealthy food:
“Think about the nutritional value of the food, my future self will thank me”

For when it’s time to do your homework:
“Block out distractions and just get started”

Be as specific as possible, and remember to avoid using the word “don’t”.
