"""Syntax Errors:"""

#SyntaxError: unterminated string Literal
    #this means that u terminated(opened) a string but forgot to unterminate(close) it.
    #in here its string 
    #And literal means quote("")
        
"""Runtime Error"""
#       It happens while ur code is running and u have to write a code inorder to defend what the user
# can expect to type or mistype.
    #1) U as a developer has keep ready(pre-code) so that if user can write exceptions or give input which u were not expecting
    #2)
    
#ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'f'
        #invalid literal = u typed(inputed) something not program is not expecting u to input
        #for int() = program is expecting some interger
        #base 10 = is decimal quote system which python is using

    #tips:
        # Write code with error handling in mind
        # Always test ur code, how may it go wrong?
        #u can use "try" & "except"
        
    # try:
    #     x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    #     print(x)
    # except ValueError:
    #     print("x is not a integer.")
    

#NameError:
#   Name 'x' is not defined
     #it happens a lot in func definations
        #because u might have just defined a function locally(local variable)
